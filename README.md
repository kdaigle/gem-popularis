# Gem Popularis

What if, before we went to RailsCamps or went onto airplanes, we could just have the most frequently
used RubyGems? Enter: Gem Popularis.

Inspired by [a tweet by @searls](https://twitter.com/searls/status/535496925680648192).

## Goals

1. A simple way to list out the gems from RubyGems based on popularity (preferably hosted so this
tool won't be used by others to cream RubyGems.org).
2. A simple gem that can then grab that list of popular RubyGems and ensure they are installed locally.
3. Let that simple gem show me what gems I installed via Gem Popularis to maybe let me find some cool
  new gems.
